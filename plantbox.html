    <h1>PlantBox: E-commerce Website Design.</h1>
    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p><a href="https://plantbox.garden/" target="_blank">PlantBox</a> is a sustainable, planting system for vertical gardens.</p>
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>The startup needed an e-commerce website and branding from scratch. Their users are landscape gardeners and members of the public with outdoor wall space who are keen to see more green.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>A responsive and scalable e-commerce website with full payment and delivery integration, along with a bold logo and brand identity.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>We launched a competition for the logo design on 99 Designs. I compiled over 40 logos into an online questionnaire and asked over 30 users within our target group for their opinions. We learned what these users value the most: elegance and simplicity.</p>
    <p>I prototyped the layout of the website firstly using paper, so that I could rapidly test the information hierarchy and accessibility. I realised that it made sense to "Shop By Category", as the PlantBox flagship product comes in 3 component parts.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://plantbox.garden/about/" target="_blank">How it Works</a> section is prominent on the page, and contains downloadable installation guides. The brand aims to be accessible and show that PlantBox can be used by people who aren't necessarily DIY aficionados; many of our users have busy lifestyles.</p>
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The new website and bold brand identity are vital steps towards upscaling the startup, and have been favourably recognised by a national garden centre that is keen to collaborate. It currently has a B2C focus, but is looking to attract more B2B customers in future.</p>
    <p><em>I'm using: Skype (user interviews), pencil and paper for rapid prototyping, Sketch app, Sketch up (3D modelling), Photoshop, Illustrator, inVision, Zeplin.</em></p>
