    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p>British Embassy in Israel in collaboration with Founders and Coders, Nazareth.</p>
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>Design a platform for promoting startups with Palestinian/Arab Founders.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>UX report and wireframes for a new platform.</p>
    <h2>Description/Process</h2>
    <p>Arab Innovators is a platform for promoting startups with Palestinian/Arab Founders. The project was commissioned by the British Embassy and developed at Founders and Coders.</p>
    <p>Just 2% of startups in Israel are run by Arab/Palestinian people, even though they represent 20% of the population. From <a href="https://github.com/UKITH/Arabs-Startups/blob/UX/UX-research.md" target="_blank">my research</a>, I deduced that this is due to a range of factors: discrimination, cultural norms, and geography all play a part.</p>
    <p>Arab Innovators aims to increase the visibility of Arab entrepreneurs in the eyes of investors, with an Events and News page that champion success stories.</p>
    <p>The aim is to create a sense of community, while showcasing talented role models. In further iterations I would like to supplement this with a newsfeed on the landing page and more of a social media presence.</p>
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>At the moment, the team and product owner are still adding to their initial database of startups and collecting feedback from their network of techpreneurs and investors.</p>
    <p>Arab Innovators is part of a wider move towards inclusion of Arab Israelis in Israel's blossoming tech culture. For some Palestinians with their high education levels, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/51eaa386-0232-11e6-99cb-83242733f755" target="_blank">technology is a lifeline.</a></p>
