    <h1>Promoting Diversity Within The Israeli Tech Scene.</h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/UKITH/Arabs-Startups" target="_blank">Arab Innovators</a> is a platform that I designed, given a brief by the British Embassy to create an online directory for startups run by Arabs in Israel.</p>
    <p>Just 2% of startups in Israel are run by Arabs, despite the fact that they represent 20% of the population. From <a href="https://github.com/UKITH/Arabs-Startups/blob/UX/UX-research.md" target="_blank">my research</a>, I deduced that this is due to a range of factors; discrimination, cultural norms, and geography all play a part.</p>
    <p>Arab Innovators aims to increase the visibility of Arab entrepreneurs in the eyes of investors, with an Events and News page that champion success stories.</p>
    <p>The aim is to create a sense of community, while showcasing talented role models. In further iterations I would like to supplement this with a newsfeed on the landing page and more of a social media presence.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the team and product owner are still adding to their initial database of startups and collecting feedback from investors.</p>

    <p>As you can see, I was initially inspired by photographs of Nazareth at night, showcasing a town with a dense Arab/Palestinian population as an almost magical place full of opportunity.</p>
