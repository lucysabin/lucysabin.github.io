    <p>Arab Innovators is a platform for promoting startups with Palestinian/Arab Founders. The project was commissioned by the British Embassy and developed at Founders and Coders.</p>
    <p>Just 2% of startups in Israel are run by Arab/Palestinian people, even though they represent 20% of the population. From <a href="https://github.com/UKITH/Arabs-Startups/blob/UX/UX-research.md" target="_blank">my research</a>, I deduced that this is due to a range of factors: discrimination, cultural norms, and geography all play a part.</p>
    <p>Arab Innovators aims to increase the visibility of Arab entrepreneurs in the eyes of investors, with an Events and News page that champion success stories.</p>
    <p>The aim is to create a sense of community, while showcasing talented role models. In further iterations I would like to supplement this with a newsfeed on the landing page and more of a social media presence.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the team and product owner are still adding to their initial database of startups and collecting feedback from their network of startups and investors.</p>
