    <h1>StopMyCraving: Product & Packaging.</h1>
    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p>StopMyCraving is a food tech company that works with independent producers. It was judged a UK Top 20 startup last year, with a place on <a href="https://medium.com/accelerace-family/startup-spotlight-stopmycraving-healthy-snacks-right-to-your-door-f8f4ab410c91" target="_blank">Europe's Number 1 accelerator programme</a> this year. Their online store enables users to search for nutritious snacks and drinks according to their lifestyle goals, dietary needs, and cravings.</p>
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>I worked closely with the developer, CEO, and nutritionist to develop user-centered products and packaging.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Based on extensive research into healthy snacking trends, I co-designed a range of seven "snack boxes" that correspond to our target users. See the Valentine's Box below...</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I held focus groups to verify hypotheses about who our target users are and what they need or want. The team then adopted a "beachhead" marketing strategy, i.e. winning over specific consumer groups in order to break into the mainstream.</p>
    <p>The contents of the boxes are selected from our range of snacks and drinks with the target user in mind, e.g. the Yummy Mummy box contains all organic products.</p>
    <p>In terms of packaging, I designed a solution that uses a neat and robust, recyclable box that can withstand international shipping and is cost effective. The logo and branding is added with custom-made stamps to retain a rustic yet bold look. The final result is exciting to receive and to open.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>With its new product range, StopMyCraving has been accepted onto Europe's no.1 accelerator programme in Europe, Accelerace. The new products are now retailing on Danish department store, Moodings.</p>
    <p><em>I'm using: Skype (user interviews), pencil and paper for rapid prototyping, Sketch app, Sketch up (3D modelling), Photoshop, Illustrator (packaging dielines), inVision, Zeplin.</em></p>
