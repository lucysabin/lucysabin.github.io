    <h1>Gladwell School of Massage: Website & Logo.</h1>
  <h2>Client</h2>
  <p>Daniel Gladwell is a renowned massage therapist with over 20 years' international experience. He gives professional training courses and needed a website and logo to showcase his school.
  <h2>Brief</h2>
  <p>Gladwell School of Massage needs to appeal to a tried and tested user group (25-35 year olds with interests in yoga and other healing practices). The branding must tie in with that of Daniel's existent personal brand, to capture and reinforce his current network.</p>
  <h2>Deliverables</h2>
  <p>Mobile-friendly website with integrated contact forms developed on Squarespace, along with a logo that clearly conveys the purpose of the school.</p>
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>We identified the key user group using Facebook analytics and user feedback. The needs of the user were pretty straightforward: find out about the school, view courses, and somehow register interest. The simple navigation that ensued is a basic solution. The bright colours are warm, upon Daniel's request, and the font is accessible, with a slightly handwritten slant. Both the colour scheme and the font reflect the approachable nature of the school.</p>
    <p><em>I'm using: pencil and paper for rapid prototyping, Squarespace for development, Photoshop for the logo.</em></p>
