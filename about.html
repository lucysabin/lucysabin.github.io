      <p class="heading">Hi there! I'm Lucy. A designer driven to create meaningful products, using tech to inspire joy. I offer consultancy, design, and full stack development. I also know about copywriting and brand.</p>
      <h2>My approach to designing and making is:</h2>
      <ul class="my-approach-list">
        <li>User-centred.</li>
        <dl>Every stage in the design process is informed by the needs or wants of the customer or "user".</dl>
        <li>Empirical and agile.</li>
        <dl>I do not make assumptions about how the user sees or experiences the world; I hypothesise and I investigate. I strongly believe in the value of obtaining user feedback, then having the agility to incorporate learnings as efficiently and effectively
          as possible.</dl>
        <li>Artistic and forward-thinking.</li>
        <dl>A self-taught coder and artist at heart, I am able to respond intelligently and sensitively to both technological and aesthetic requirements.</dl>
        <li>Holistic and empathetic.</li>
        <dl>I think about design in terms of crafting a dynamic experience, rather than a static thing, syncing with the user's lifestyle, thoughts, feelings, and sensations. My ultimate aim is to create something that resonates with the user's identity,
          and the way they perceive or experience the world.</br>
        Having studied phenomenology and embodiment philosophies in an academic capacity, I am deeply interested in how the body mediates our subjective experiences, of tech and beyond. In practise, I enjoy exploring interconnectedness and working with freeing bodily blocks as a part-time <a href="http://www.lucyroseyoga.com/" target="_blank">yoga teacher.</a></dl>

      <h2>So what's my story?</h2>
      <p>Creativity and curiosity defined my formative years, and underpin who I am today.</br></br>My 16-year-old self dreamed of becoming a Textile Artist; I was determined to fill my life with colour and texture. </br></br>By 18, however, my focus had shifted to Modern Languages and Philosophy. A big part of me was drawn
        to exploring other cultures and questioning fundamental truths about human nature. So I applied to read Liberal Arts at Durham.  </br>
        </br>
        I taught myself how to code in my student bedroom, using online resources. Programming just seemed like a new syntax and vocabulary, alongside French and Spanish, except I could build things with it. I was excited by this newfound outlet for my creative
        side. </br>
        </br>Whilst on a year abroad, I studied Fine Art in Spain. Specifically, this entailed: painting and colour theory, drawing and composition, sculpting and installation art. It was then that I began to realise what I truly wanted to do: make beautiful
        things that solve real human needs. </br>
        </br>My final year dissertation was as contemporary as possible; it applied the philosophical theories of embodiment and extended cognition to recent Spanish horror film. In a nutshell, I argued that the human body plays an interactive role in film
        viewing, because the emotions and sense memories that arise in the spectator are bodily phenomena. In many ways, the filmmaker is like an interaction designer, attempting to involve the audience and craft a moving experience. </br>
        </br>On graduating Durham, I became PR and Social Media Manager of startup, SheCanCode. This was thanks to a popular blog I'd started about learning to code, as well as my prolific portfolio of freelance writing as Art and Travel Editor of the University
        magazine. Managing Comms for SheCanCode proved to be a varied role that provided me with unique insights into the technology industry. It inspired me to deepen my programming knowledge. Thus, I applied for the competitive Founders & Coders JavaScript
        bootcamp. </br>
        </br>During my 16 weeks at Founders and Coders, we worked in small teams on week-long sprints. I relished the challenge of coding. But my heart wasn't 100% invested. I felt much more passionate about making sure that the final product would fulfil
        the needs and wants of our users (even if they were hypothetical at first). People saw value in what I was doing. So I began to consciously develop my natural tendencies towards a UX point of view, so that I could be more useful to the network
        of developers around me, principally as a designer, who can also write logically-sound code, and prototype like a worker bee. </br>
        </br>I think developers enjoy having me on the team, because I can speak their language, and understand the implications of what I am asking them to build. Product Owners who consider themselves "non-technical" feel that they can trust me as well,
        because I have their best interests at heart.  </br>
        </br>I'm so grateful to be able to fulfil my passion for user-centred design, balancing the creative and analytical aspects of my personality. I still consider myself a philosopher and cultural theorist, except the objective of my research nowadays
        is to develop empathy... isn't that a wonderful thing? </br>
      </br>My master plan is to continue accumulating skills and wisdom as an Interaction Designer.</p>
