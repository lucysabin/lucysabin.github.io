      <h2>My approach to designing and making is:</h2>
      <ul class="my-approach-list">
        <h3><li>User-centred.</li></h3>
        <dl>Every stage in the design process is informed by the needs or wants of the customer or "user".</dl>
        <h3><li>Empirical and agile.</li></h3>
        <dl>I do not make assumptions about how the user sees or experiences the world; I hypothesise and I investigate. I strongly believe in the value of obtaining user feedback, then having the agility to incorporate learnings as efficiently and effectively
          as possible.</dl>
        <h3><li>Artistic and forward-thinking.</li></h3>
        <dl>A self-taught coder and artist at heart, I am able to respond intelligently and sensitively to both technological and aesthetic requirements.</dl>
        <h3><li>Holistic and empathetic.</li></h3>
        <dl>I think about design in terms of crafting a dynamic experience, rather than a static thing, syncing with the user's lifestyle, thoughts, feelings, and sensations. My ultimate aim is to create something that resonates with the user's identity,
          and the way they perceive or experience the world.</br>
        <!-- Having studied phenomenology and embodiment philosophies in an academic capacity, I am deeply interested in how the body mediates our subjective experiences, of tech and beyond. In practise, I enjoy exploring interconnectedness and working with freeing bodily blocks as a part-time <a href="http://www.lucyroseyoga.com/" target="_blank">yoga teacher.</a></dl> -->
      </ul>

      <!-- <h2>So what's my story?</h2>
      <p>I have always been particularly intrigued by colour, texture, and form. Indeed, when I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a Textile Artist.</p>
      <p>Lured by the intellectual challenges of the Humanities, however, I went on to study Modern Languages and Philosophy at Durham.</p>
      <p>I started teaching myself to code in my student bedroom. I also reconnected with the art world by spending my third year abroad, studying Bellas Artes at the Universidad de Vigo in Spain.</p>
      <p>Moving image culture became a real passion at university; my final year dissertation applied the philosophical theories of embodiment and extended cognition to recent Spanish horror film. In many ways, the filmmaker is like an interaction designer, who looks to involve the audience in a journey, by crafting an emotional, sensual experience.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I guess you could say that a big part of me is drawn to exploring other cultures and questioning assumptions about human nature; this outlook continues to inform my freelance writing portfolio and open-minded approach as a designer.</p>
      <p>Since graduating Durham, I have worked in digital media, honing my coding, communication, and design skills.</p>
      <p>As a UX Designer at Founders and Coders, I work with small teams to develop digital products using an agile/lean methodology. We work with everyone from education and mental health charities to industrial and e-commerce platforms.
      <p>I also consult with startups on their digital strategy.</p>
      <p>I think developers enjoy having me on the team, because I can speak their language, and understand the implications of what I am asking them to build. Whereas product owners who consider themselves “not particularly technical" feel that they can trust me to do a great job, because I have their best interests at heart.</p>
      <p>I'm so grateful to be able to fulfil my passion for user-centred design, balancing the creative and analytical sides of my personality. I still consider myself a philosopher and cultural theorist, except the objective of my research nowadays is to develop empathy and, ultimately, come up with a creative solution. Isn't that a wonderful thing?</p>
