      <p class="heading">Hi there! I'm Lucy. A designer driven to create meaningful products, using tech to inspire joy. I offer consultancy, design, and full stack development. I also know about copywriting and brand.</p>
      <h2>My approach to designing and making is:</h2>
      <ul class="my-approach-list">
        <li>User-centred.</li>
        <dl>Every stage in the design process is informed by the needs or wants of the customer or "user".</dl>
        <li>Empirical and agile.</li>
        <dl>I do not make assumptions about how the user sees or experiences the world; I hypothesise and I investigate. I strongly believe in the value of obtaining user feedback, then having the agility to incorporate learnings as efficiently and effectively
          as possible.</dl>
        <li>Artistic and forward-thinking.</li>
        <dl>A self-taught coder and artist at heart, I am able to respond intelligently and sensitively to both technological and aesthetic requirements.</dl>
        <li>Holistic and empathetic.</li>
        <dl>I think about design in terms of crafting a dynamic experience, rather than a static thing, syncing with the user's lifestyle, thoughts, feelings, and sensations. My ultimate aim is to create something that resonates with the user's identity,
          and the way they perceive or experience the world.</br>
        Having studied phenomenology and embodiment philosophies in an academic capacity, I am deeply interested in how the body mediates our subjective experiences, of tech and beyond. In practise, I enjoy exploring interconnectedness and working with freeing bodily blocks as a part-time <a href="http://www.lucyroseyoga.com/" target="_blank">yoga teacher.</a></dl>

      <h2>So what's my story?</h2>
      <p>When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a Textile Artist, so that I could live a life full of colour and texture.</p>

<p>Lured by the deep thinking of academia, however, I went on to study Modern Languages and Philosophy at Durham. A big part of me is drawn to exploring other cultures and questioning assumptions about human nature, an outlook which informs my approach to design.</p>

<p>My creative and analytical tendencies coalesced when I started teaching myself how to code, using online resources in my student bedroom. Then spending my third year enrolled on a Fine Art course in Spain helped me to reconnect with the artist mindset.</p>

<p>I loved analysing moving image culture at university, with a final year dissertation that applied the philosophical theories of embodiment and extended cognition to recent Spanish horror film. In many ways, the filmmaker is like an interaction designer, looking to involve the audience and craft an emotional, sensual experience.</p>

<p>On graduating Durham, I became PR and Social Media Manager of startup, SheCanCode. This was thanks to a popular blog I'd started about learning to code, as well as my prolific portfolio of freelance writing as Art and Travel Editor of the University magazine.</p>

<p>Managing Comms for SheCanCode proved to be a varied role that provided me with unique insights into the technology industry. It inspired me to deepen my programming knowledge. Thus, I applied for the competitive Founders & Coders JavaScript bootcamp.</p> 

<p>Founders and Coders gave me my first taste of agile, lean development. We would work in small teams, and I tended to fill the UX role. People saw the value in what I was doing. So I up skilled as a UX designer and have made myself an attribute to the network of developers around me.</p> 

<p>I think developers enjoy having me on the team, because I can speak their language, and understand the implications of what I am asking them to build. Product Owners who consider themselves “not particularly technical" feel that they can trust me as well, because I have their best interests at heart.</p>

<p>I'm so grateful to be able to fulfil my passion for user-centred design, balancing the creative and analytical aspects of my personality. I still consider myself a philosopher and cultural theorist, except the objective of my research nowadays is to develop empathy... isn't that a wonderful thing?</p>

<p>My master plan is to continue accumulating skills and wisdom as an Interaction Designer.</p>
