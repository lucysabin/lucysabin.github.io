    <h1>Overcoming Communication Barriers With Makaton Sign Language.</h1>
    <p>MakaTalk is an iPad web app developed to help young people with learning difficulties to express how they are feeling.</p>
    </p>Our product owners are two clinicians who currently use paper forms to assess the emotional wellbeing of their patients before and after a therapy session.</p>
    <p> The problem is, for many of their young patients, a paper form is just too abstract, causing a communication barrier. In fact, often their parent or guardian will fill in the form on their behalf, leading to inaccurate data.</p>
    <p>We wanted to transform these paper forms into a tactile audiovisual experience that the patient could be immersed in.</p>
    <img src="./imgs/makatalk-options.png" alt="" class="project-img">
    <p>It was an interesting challenge to figure out how the user would select their answer. Our solution is to autoplay a Youtube playlist when the page loads, highlighting the options (image thumbnails) as each is enacted in Makaton. The options are at the bottom of the screen, so that the main video isn't covered up while they tap away on the tablet.</p>
    <p>Alpha testing in a therapy setting has shown that our users prefer responding to a video interface. But they would like to see "more exciting animations".</p>
    <p><em>I used: pencil and paper, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.</em></p>
