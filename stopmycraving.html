    <h1>StopMyCraving: UX design for an e-commerce food tech startup.</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/stopmycraving-box.png" alt="" class="project-img">
    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p>StopMyCraving is a healthy snacks company, judged a UK Top 20 startup last year, with a place on Europe's Number 1 accelerator programme this year.</p>
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>I have been working closely with the developer, CEO, and nutritionist to improve the user journey since October 2017.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Documented insights into customer behaviour, re-design of entire e-commerce platform (under construction), design of new "snack boxes" to suit user needs, and recyclable packaging with branding (pictured).</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>StopMyCraving are growing rapidly. Each design phase is as efficient as possible. I conduct user testing with targeted groups to measure key variables that impact sales figures. Because of the business aims, a lot of my work has revolved around investigating customer behaviour when they are hungry or experiencing specific cravings.</p>
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Since I joined StopMyCraving in October as a freelancer, they have been accepted onto a major accelerator programme in Europe. The new products and packaging I've created are now retailing on Danish department store, Moodings.</p>
    <p><em>I'm using: Skype (user interviews), pencil and paper for rapid prototyping, Sketch app, Sketch up (3D modelling), Photoshop, Illustrator, inVision, Zeplin.</em></p>
